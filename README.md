The application is built using the functional language [Clean](https://clean.cs.ru.nl/Clean), the TOP library [iTasks](https://clean.cs.ru.nl/ITasks) and [mTask](https://gitlab.science.ru.nl/mlubbers/mTask/tree/peripherals).

Requirements
-----------
* Clean
* CLM
* CPM
* iTasks

All of the requirements are available as one bundle [here](https://clean.cs.ru.nl/Download_Clean). Follow the instructions under "Clean and iTasks (Development)" and download `clean-bundle-itasks'.

Building

To build the application, run `make` on the repository directory.

Running

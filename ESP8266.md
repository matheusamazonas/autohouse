# ESP8266 Wifi Module

Instructions on how to configure an ESP8266 module in order to use it on AutoHouse.

Notice that we're using the ESP8266 as WiFi module only. We're not using it as a microcontroller directly.

The ESP8266 I [bought from Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01LK83TX0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is the "01" model. Its standard baud rate is 115200, which is different from the Arduino Uno's serial port baud rate (9600). It only supports 3.3V and an external power source should be used with it since the current the USB port provides is not enough.

AT Commands
----------------------

We communicate with the WiFi module via AT commands. All comands should end with a line break (CR and NL). Some relevant commants:

* Set WiFi mode (not saved in flash): `AT+CWMODE_CUR=0` (1: Station mode, 2: SoftAP mode, 3: SoftAP+Station mode)
* Set WiFi mode (saved in flash): `AT+CWMODE_CUR=0` (1: Station mode, 2: SoftAP mode, 3: SoftAP+Station mode)
* Set UART configuration (not saved in flash): `AT+UART_CUR=115200,8,1,0,0`
* Set UART configuration (saved in flash): `AT+UART_DEF=115200,8,1,0,0`
* Connect to WiFi (not saved in flash) : `AT+CWJAP_CUR="ssid","pwd"`
* Connect to WiFi (saved in flash) : `AT+CWJAP_DEF="ssid","pwd"`
* Get the local IP address: `AT+CIFSR`
* Enable/disable multiple connections: `AT+CIPMUX=1` (0 disable, 1 enable)
* Deletes/create TCP server: `AT+CIPSERVER=1,<port>` (1st arg: enable/disable)
* Restore factory settings: `AT+RESTORE`

Setting it up for the first time
----------------------
We need to send AT commands to the module in order to set it up for the first time. To send commands, we need to connect to the ESP8266 microcontroller directly. We can use either a TTY-USB or the Arduino Uno as an interface.

#### Using the Arduino to configure the ESP8266

First, we need to set up the Arduino to be used as a bridge, bypassing all communication to its serial port. We do it by connecting the Arduino's `RESET` pin to one of the ground (`GND`) pins. Then, we connect the WiFi module to the Arduino:

| ESP8266    | Arduino    |
| ---------- |:----------:|
| VCC        | 3.3V       |
| GND        | GND        | 
| RX         | RX         | 
| TX         | TX         | 
| CH_PD      | 3.3V       |
| GPIO 0     | None       |
| GPIO 2     | None       |

Then, turn the Arduino on, open the Arduino IDE, select the Arduino board and open the Serial Monitor (tools, serial monitor).

Select the baud rate (115200) and the line break (both CR and NL) and we're ready to send AT commands. First send "AT" and check if the response is "OK". If not, something is wrong, either with the wiring or with the Arduino connection to the PC.

#### Sending commands



Let's set it up for usage with Autohouse. 
* First, change its default baud rate to 9600: `AT+UART_DEF=9600,8,1,0,0`

   The Arduino's UART default settings is baudrate=9600 and 8-N-1 (8 data bits, no parity bit, and 1 stop bit).
* Set the Serial Monitor's baud rate to 9600
* Set the WiFi mode to client: `AT+CWMODE_DEF=1`
* Connect to Wifi: `AT+CWJAP_DEF="wifi_name","password"`

   The response should be `WIFI CONNECTED` followed by `WIFI GOT IP`

* Get the module's IP address: `AT+CIFSR`

The following commands are executed by the mTask client automatically, but are useful for debugging purposes:
* Enable multiple connections: `AT+CIPMUX=1`
* Create TCP Server: `AT+CIPSERVER=1,<port>`
* Disable connection timeout: `AT+CIPSTO=0`

Using the ESP8266 as Arduino Serial
---------------------

Once the WiFi module is configured, we need to use it as an interface for Arduino Serial. Since now we want to use the WiFi module to communicate with the Arduino, the `TX` and `RX` cables must be swapped. Remove the cable connecting Arduino's `RESET` to `GND` and wire the ESP8266 as:

| ESP8266    | Arduino    |
| ---------- |:----------:|
| VCC        | 3.3V       |
| GND        | GND        | 
| TX         | RX         | 
| RX         | TX         | 
| CH_PD      | 3.3V       |
| GPIO 0     | None       |
| GPIO 2     | None       |

Finally, ESP8266 should be ready to use on AutoHouse
